            WingCash is a national digital currency platform for the Federal
            Reserve that extends the US dollar into the digital realm. The
            WingCash Faster Payments Network (FPN) is an end-to-end solution
            providing digital fiat currency to improve the U.S. payment system.
            Using the FPN platform, the
            Federal Reserve<a href="#disclaimer" class="smooth-scroll disclaimer-link">*</a>
            distributes digital
            Federal Reserve Notes (i.e. digital coins and bills) to depository
            institutions. This new digital capability permits the Federal
            Reserve to continue to perform its core function of managing the
            money supply, while providing clear public benefits through
            broad-based, non-discriminatory access to an efficient and
            effective means of electronic commerce.
          </p>
          <p>
            The FPN is competitively neutral and cost effective. It will enable
            the Federal Reserve to continue to ensure the integrity of the
            payments system.

        <p>
          The WingCash platform is specifically designed to achieve the public
          policy goals stated in the Federal Reserve’s Strategies for
          Improving the U.S. Payment System. The system successfully balances
          various stakeholder interests while also satisfying stakeholder
          expectations through a combined public and private ownership
          structure and the implementation of a proven governance model.

        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the roles and responsibilities proposed for the
          Federal Reserve<a href="#disclaimer" class="smooth-scroll disclaimer-link">*</a>,
          we also propose roles and responsibilities for the
          Department of the Treasury<a href="#disclaimer" class="smooth-scroll disclaimer-link">*</a>.
          Specifically, the proposal calls for the
          extension of the the FedCash Service to include authorized
          issuance of digital bills and coins (Fed notes) with a complementary
          and tightly integrated Global Directory Service (GDS).

        <h2 class="section-title">HOW IT WORKS</h2>
        <p>
          The WingCash platform design is different from the design of
          accounting systems like depository institutions use to manage
          customer balances. Rather, the platform utilizes a system of
          addresses (URLs) that allow individuals and businesses to safely and
          securely transfer value.
        </p>
        <p>
          The WingCash Faster Payments Network (FPN) has distinct parts. The
          first part allows the United States Department of the Treasury to
          design and issue digital Fed notes. The second part operated by the
          Federal Reserve and/or a Governing Organization is a global
          directory service that publishes to the public, distributes to
          depository institutions and records the transfer of Fed notes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The WingCash FPN reduces the societal costs of payments and improves
          payment efficiency by reducing the number of steps associated with
          current payments processes from eight to three.

          The FPN’s design allows depository institutions to continue their
          current roles and responsibilities of ordering Fed notes from the
          Federal Reserve, distributing Fed notes to their customers, and
          acting as depository institutions for Fed notes for their consumer
          and business customers. Depository institutions can also use an
          Application Programming Interface (API) to provide value added
          services to their customers such as currency conversion, cross
          border payments, or enabling digital currency use in a popular
          mobile application. Consumers and businesses hold and transfer
          possession of Fed notes to make payments using any type of supported
          communication device (i.e. mobile phone, tablet, personal computer)
          or no device at all, using a payment code.

        <h2 class="section-title">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>

        <h4>Involvement by the Federal Reserve</h4>

        <div class="faq-question">
          Does the Fed have authority to issue digital bills and coins?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Digital banknotes should be treated as authorized by the Federal
            Reserve Act to the same extent as physical banknotes. Section
            16(1) of the Federal Reserve Act is silent as to the medium in
            which Federal Reserve notes are to be issued. Accordingly, it
            may be argued that digital banknotes are encompassed within the
            general authority of Paragraph 1. Digital Fed notes would not
            replace physical bills and coins but would be an additional
            service offered by the Fed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">
          Do the people want the Fed to play a role?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The people want a financial system that serves their purposes
            and protects their interests. If the FPN provides an additional
            option for payments that is easy to use, secure, cost-effective,
            and accepted by the establishments that consumers do business
            with, they are likely to accept it without a lot of
            consideration for the mechanics that make the system possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are assured that not all consumers or businesses would like
            to have the Fed provide digital bills and coins for the FPN;
            however, consumers and businesses are best served by a safe,
            efficient, trusted payment ecoystem. The Fed’s role in the FPN
            would bring the highest levels of public confidence to the FPN.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">
          Will the Federal Reserve adopt the FPN?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The Proposer cannot speak on behalf of the Federal Reserve;
            however, the Fed's operation of the FPN would provide the highest
            level of credibility and trust in the FPN.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the strengths of the proposed FPN is its flexibility with
            respect to the role of depository financial institutions in the
            chain of distribution of digital banknotes. For example, the Fed
            could engage depository institutions to act as intermediaries with
            respect to the distribution of digital banknotes, similar to their
            role with respect to the distribution of paper Federal Reserve
            notes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Administration of the Global Directory Service, the “back-office”
            machinery necessary for authentication and recording, and numerous
            other aspects of the Faster Payments Network, may be delegated to
            the Governing Organization or a service provider as the Fed sees
            fit. The proposer’s intent is not to dictate whether or how the
            Fed may exercise its discretion to delegate operation of the
            various components of the FPN; rather, where the FPN contemplates
            operative concepts from the point of view of Fed action, it should
            be understood to refer to action by the Fed or its designee, and
            not to derogate from the Fed’s flexibility to delegate or
            otherwise involve the Governing Organization, its members, or
            other third parties as necessary or appropriate to provide the
            FPN.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">
          If the Federal Reserve chooses not to adopt the solution, what are
          other options that could keep the solution viable?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The multi-issuer design of the FPN makes it possible for a
            commercial bank to act as distributor of the Fed notes held
            against a balance in an ominibus account; however, our experience
            suggests that commercial banks resist this role and responsibility
            for many reasons. In the model with one or more commercial banks
            as providers of the notes, the Fed would not need to act as the
            issuer or redeemer.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4>Financial Viability</h4>

        <div class="faq-question">
          How is the FPN paid for?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The Federal Reserve can expect to receive full recovery of costs
            over the long run by directing savings from reduced printing,
            transportation and destructions costs of physical bank note issuance
            into the operation of the FPN. However, the implementation of the
            FPN would require an investment by the Federal Reserve.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">
          What revenue streams exist to pay for the operation of the FPN?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The Federal Reserve will continue to recognize seigniorage for Fed
            notes issued to the FPN. We also propose other possible revenue
            streams associated with the FPN, although we do not prescribe who
            will record the revenue, as follows: distribution of brand cash,
            co-branding of Fed notes, deposit fees, education and training,
            membership, and more.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">
          Will the likely reduction of revenue in existing payment systems
          make the stakeholders of those systems resist or be slow to adopt
          the FPN?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes, we expect stakeholders of other payment systems to be slow to
            or resist adoption of the FPN because of the potential loss of
            revenue as payments shift from existing payment systems to the
            FPN. However, financial institutions will be able to realize
            additional revenue by determining the fee charged to the customer
            for depositing Fed notes to an account. Depository institutions
            using the API with their own branded applications are able to
            offer the baseline services and value-added services for their
            customers. Value-added services may generate revenue for
            depository institutions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">
          Will financial institutions have to absorb losses from the system?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            No, unlike payment card networks, the proposed design and rules of
            the FPN do not have financial institutions responsible for
            chargebacks. Financial institutions will benefit from reduced risk
            of payments that use the FPN because there is no inter-provider
            credit or liquidity risk when accepting Fed notes for deposit.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4>Business Model</h4>

        <div class="faq-question">
          Are consumer or business accounts on the FPN the same as a checking
          or savings account at a depository institution?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The FPN is designed as a bearer instrument payment network. The
            FPN is not a system of accounts that use double-entry accounting
            (e.g., debits and credits) to move value between accounts.
            Consequently, the FPN does not compete with depository financial
            institutions for deposit accounts of consumers or businesses.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">
          Can the FPN handle the billions of web pages needed and the
          transactions necessary at scale?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The FPN will create and store data for each Fed note on the FPN.
            While this may seem like a lot of data, even with billions of Fed
            notes, it is rather small by comparison to some existing web
            sites. For example, YouTube reports that “every day people watch
            hundreds of millions of hours on YouTube and generate billions of
            views.” Serving hundreds of millions of hours of YouTube video
            places a high demand on computing resources (i.e., computer
            processing power, network bandwidth, and storage), whereas the
            FPN’s serving static/dynamic web pages demands significantly less
            computing resources.
          </p>

          <p>
            The FPN can scale quickly while maintaining service level
            agreements and providing the baseline core features because of an
            original design architecture that supports high scalability.
          </p>

          <p>
            The proposers have tested the transaction throughput of the
            current version without much code optimization using
            Amazon EC2 Type C3 instances with 32 cores and 60 GB of memory.
            The current version was able to achieve projected
            annual transaction throughput rate in excess of 23 billion
            transfers per year (750 transactions per second, 64.8 million
            transactions per day). To put this in perspective, VocaLink, the
            operator of the UK’s Faster Payments system, indicates on their
            website that their data centers process just over 6 billion BACS
            transactions annually (16.44 million per day), with a peak
            reaching 100 million transactions per day (36.5 billion
            transactions annually). The proposers believe that, with both
            hardware and software optimizations, the transaction throughput of
            the FPN at implementation can be improved to reach or exceed 220+
            billion transfers per year, or 602.7 million transfers per day.
            The FPN’s architecture is designed to accommodate growth with
            additional code optimization and through horizontal scale.

          Can the FPN be protected from DDoS attacks?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The FPN includes the following measures to mitigate the impact of
            external network attacks:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Because attackers often try to connect to database servers
              directly through network ports, the FPN employs external
              firewalls that reject all attempts to connect to non-public
              ports.
            </li>

            <li>
              The FPN mitigates denial of service (DoS) attacks by providing
              flexible server capacity and by adjusting firewall rules in real
              time to temporarily block specific abusive IP addresses.
            </li>

            <li>
              The FPN serves static copies of web pages in the event of an
              extreme DoS attack. Because copies of static web pages require
              few server resources, it is more difficult for attackers to
              overwhelm servers that serve static copies of web pages.
            </li>

            <li>
              The proposers recommend the creation of a site reliability
              engineering (SRE) team to monitor the network and build automated
              detection and response systems.

          they treated like other businesses?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
              The FPN operates the same for government agencies as with
            public/private businesses;  however, the API allows a degree of
            freedom to a business or government agency to customize the
            features or experience of the FPN. Government and charitable
            organizations that distribute humanitarian aid would have the
            option to distribute a closed-loop payment instrument (Brand Cash)
            redeemable only at certain locations to provide better control of
            where humanitarian aid is redeemed and for what products and or
            services.

          How does the FPN enable providers of core banking systems to enable
          domain aliasing capability?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The FPN’s domain aliasing capability allows FPN features to be
            aliased to the web domain of a financial institution. For example,
            a financial insitution with a domain of
            www.firstfinancialinstitution.com could be set up to provide its
            customers customized, branded acess and user experience to the FPN

        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            While it would be convenient, it is not to the consumers’ benefit
            to be auto-enrolled in the FPN through their financial
            institutions. The FPN enrollment process enables participants in
            the system to specify their credentials and keep them private.
            Enrollment that is not linked to a financial institution also
            expands access to the solution to unbanked individuals. For
            convenience, the FPN allows those who have accounts with
            depository financial institutions to link their payment addresses
            to their accounts.

            Transactions within the FPN are immediate and are performed with
            good funds (i.e. central bank money) that are currently held by
            the payer’s primary payment address. The purpose of the FPN is to
            execute transfers in real-time, all day, every day without human
            intervention and provide confirmation of the completed transfer to
            both the payer and the payee.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            A user on the FPN can link an account at a financial institution
            to her primary payment address and submit a payment order to
            transfer Fed notes to that account. Users can purchase goods and
            services with funds held by their primary payment address. Fed
            notes on the FPN are also fungible with physical bills and coins.

        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The FPN displays contextual data to inform users. The FPN records,
            retains, protects, discloses, and makes available to the payer,
            payee, and issuer appropriate contextual data as permitted by the
            rules. Contextual data may include but is not limited to the
            following:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Transfer identification (each transfer is assigned a system-
              wide, unique ID)
            </li>
            <li>
              Transfer type (transfer types as defined by the system)
            </li>
            <li>
              Date and time the transfer was started
            </li>
            <li>
              Date and time the transfer was completed or ended
            </li>
            <li>
              Status of the transfer
            </li>
            <li>
              Amount of the transfer
            </li>
            <li>
              Visibility of the transfer (i.e., public or private)
            </li>
            <li>
              Appropriate details about each participant or stakeholder
              involved in the transfer
            </li>
            <li>
              Fed notes involved in the transfer by unique identifier
            </li>
            <li>
              Closed-loop notes involved in the transfer, including the type
              of the note (e.g., gift, loyalty, rewards, promotional), the
              name the notes Issuer, the denomination, and the date of
              issuance
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The FPN may also capture and record contextual data that include
            channel- and device-specific information. For example, data may
            include device operating system, device hardware identifiers,
            device application identifiers, or device location information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Contextual information associated with a transfer can be viewed by
            a stakeholder of the transfer to perform all types of
            responsibilities including updating double-entry accounting
            systems, preparing reports, preparing tax statements, auditing,
            and investigating errors.
          </p>

          <p>
            The FPN enables flexibility in contextual data and integration of

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The Fed notes held by a person or business would be subject to all

        <h4>Governance</h4>

        <div class="faq-question">
          Who would have rule- or regulation-making responsibility for the FPN?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The same organizations that write regulations and laws for payment
            systems that exist today would have the ability to impact the
            FPN’s rules. These organizations include the CFPB, Federal Reserve
            Board of Governors, Office of Comptroller of Currency, etc.
            Furthermore, the solution proposes an inclusive Governing
            Organization with broad participation from all stakeholders on the
            FPN to also have rule-making influence.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">
          Who has responsibility for compliance with BSA/AML/OFAC/KYC
          requirements?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The Fed would bear the responsibility for compliance with
            regulations in the ongoing operation of the FPN with established
            users. As the owner and operator of the FPN, the Fed could
            designate certain responsibilities to be performed by the
            Governing Organization. Compliance with BSA/AML/KYC may be
            delegated by the Fed to the Governing Organization.
          </p>

          <p>
            Financial institutions that are issued digital Fed notes from the
            Federal Reserve would be authorized to redistribute the digital
            banknotes to customers who have satisfied anti-money laundering
            (AML) and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) screens.
            Moreover, the recipients of those digital banknotes would be able
            to transfer them only to persons (individuals and entities) whose
            identity had been validated in accordance with applicable AML and
            OFAC standards by banks authorized by the Fed for that purpose.
          </p>

          <p>
            With strong front-end identity verification requirements, the FPN
            would enable AML-related controls far exceeding those currently in
            place for cash transactions. In addition, the FPN architecture
            supports a multi-tiered approach to the user base, with holders
            who have not undergone bank identity verification subject to hard-
            wired transactional limits (e.g., based on the number or dollar
            value of transactions during a specified period), while holders
            who have undergone screening may be subject to less stringent
            limits, or, if the digital banknotes held by such users are linked
            to an account, no limits other than restrictions applicable to
            those of any other holder of a bank account (e.g., standard OFAC
            blocks and suspicious activity reporting). Such a multi-tiered
            approach would both preserve widespread access to digital
            banknotes, and allow financial institutions to maintain their
            gatekeeper role for transactions at levels designated by the Fed.

            Although there is a version of the FPN operating in
            the market, if adopted by the Federal Reserve, the proposer
            recommends replacing open source components with commercial
            applications. The proposer estimates that the process of replacing
            open source components with commercial applications and
            preparing the FPN to operate at scale may take between 9 to 18
            months. This period of technical preparation will allow time for
            the Governing Organization to ratify the rules for the FPN, and
            large merchants will have the necessary lead time to prepare their
            systems for acceptance of FPN payments and distribution of Brand
            Cash.

            which have undergone some modifications during the solution
            proposal process. It is a high-level timeline. Upon adoption of
            the solution, a detailed timeline would be developed with input
            from stakeholders. The detailed timeline would include milestones
            for governance, legal and regulatory requirements, design,
            implementation, and adoption by governmental and private key
            players, including the Fed’s issuing of digital Fed notes,
            merchants’ implementing the solution, and consumers’ being able to
            use it for payments.

            The technology to support the FPN has been in development since
            January of 2009 and operating in local markets since 2011. The
            current version is interoperable with existing payment
            systems, including the ACH network, the payment card networks, the
            bill pay networks, and other payment networks.
          </p>

          <p>
            The following features have already been implemented in the current
            version of the payment platform:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Enrollment for persons in the U.S. and other countries as
              permitted by the rules
            </li>

            <li>
              Enrollment for businesses in the U.S. including federal, state
              and local governments, retailers, etc., and for businesses in
              other countries as permitted by the rules
            </li>

            <li>
              Enrollment for depository institutions in the U.S. and in other
              countries as permitted by the rules
            </li>

            <li>
              Enrollment and support for national currency issuance by central
              banks in other countries as permitted by the rules
            </li>

            <li>
              ACH network integration and support for transfer of funds to
              accounts held at depository institutions
            </li>

            <li>
              Support for businesses and governments to issue closed-loop
              value (e.g., gift, loyalty, rewards, promotional, humanitarian,
              and welfare programs) with offers and campaign tracking
              (Businesses administer their own closed-loop networks with
              appropriate distribution and redemption agreements for network
              participants.)
            </li>

            <li>
              Support for sharing data using open data sharing formats,
              including a live web page (e.g., HTML5), Atom, JSON, and
              streaming
            </li>

            <li>
              Open API using OAuth2 for integrators
            </li>

            <li>
              Features to support customized branding by depository
              institutions and regulated non-bank providers using domain name
              aliasing and themes
            </li>

            <li>
              Reports, including transfer history, page groups, provider
              liabilities, distribution and redemption, received, and
              receivable
            </li>

            <li>
              Support for businesses to have payment addresses with public
              information published in the Global Directory Service
            </li>

            <li>
              Automatic sweep to deposit account with a fixed fee per sweep
            </li>

            <li>
              Administrative features include:
              <ul>
                <li>Payment address management</li>
                <li>Enrollment management</li>

              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In addition to the above features that already have been tested
            in the current implementation of the platform, the FPN’s
            design would maintain the business relationships that exist
            between stakeholders. For example, depository institutions are
            members of the Federal Reserve System and order Federal bank
            notes from the Federal Reserve; with the introduction of the
            FPN, depository institutions will be transferred digital Fed
            notes electronically rather than receiving printed notes by
            armored car services. Depository institutions also maintain the
            relationships they have with their customers (e.g., provide
            customers with Fed notes when requested and accept Fed notes for
            deposit). Regulated non-bank providers maintain the
            relationships they have with their customers (e.g., cash
            advances, loans, check cashing). Businesses also maintain the
            relationships they have with their depository institutions and
            their customers. The FPN is a platform to enable transfers
            between all parties enrolled without requiring modification of
            existing relationships between participants.

        <div class="faq-question">
          How are the records of ownership protected?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The records of ownership of Fed notes can be protected by using a
            distributed ledger to record a hash of details for a transfer at
            each step in the work flow and a hash of the completed work flow
            and final transfer. While the hashed information can be written to
            a public distributed ledger without disclosing private details
            about the transfer, permissioned parties are able to store an
            independent copy of the hashed information and verify it against
            the transfer details to protect and verify the integrity of the
            FPN.

            The solution protects the personal information for end users, the

            transit and at rest.
          </p>

          <p>The FPN encrypts data in transit as follows:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Data in transit between servers and clients is encrypted using
              Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTPS) using Transport
              Layer Security (TLS) consistent with the guidelines published by
              NIST.
            </li>
            <li>
              Data in transit between servers is encrypted using TLS
              encryption.
            </li>
            <li>
              The FPN uses a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to secure the
              communications for some administrative processes and services.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>The FPN encrypts data at rest as follows:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Certain records at rest in the database are hashed (e.g.,
              passwords) using secure hashing algorithms consistent with
              guidelines published by NIST.
            </li>
            <li>
              All data at rest on hard drives are encrypted using algorithms
              based on Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), a NIST-adopted
              standard.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The solution’s risk management framework also protects consumers
            from fraud in the following ways:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The FPN uses push payments exclusively instead of allowing the
              payee to pull from the payer’s payment address.
            </li>
            <li>
              The FPN does not share sensitive information (e.g., account
              numbers, card numbers, personal information, etc.) with the
              payee.
            </li>
            <li>
              In contrast to checks or payment cards, only known individuals
              with valid payer credentials are authorized to access the
              payer’s payment address and to sign payment orders.
            </li>
            <li>
              The FPN offers the Federal Reserve and the Governing
              Organization ability to regulate and oversee the function and
              operation of the system including the ability to analyze the
              source, destination and amount for all transfers in lieu of
              identity verification for every individual.
            </li>
            <li>
              The FPN supports optional two-factor authentication that when
              activated assures that the individual authenticating is also in
              current possession of protected secret information (i.e., token
              generated from biometric information).
            </li>
            <li>
              The FPN’s payment order dialog supports reverifying the presence
              and possession of the secret information (i.e., token generated
              from biometric information) before the payer’s signature will be
              applied to the payment order.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">
          Why does the FPN allow single-factor authentication?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The FPN also employs a username and password or passphrase pair as
            a method to verify an end user’s identity to satisfy end user
            expectations. End users can establish multi-factor authentication
            for enhanced security. Additional means of authentication can
            include one-time passwords using a secondary communication channel
            (e.g., sms/text message), one-time passwords using a separate
            application (e.g., VIP Access from Symantec, Google Authenticator)
            or a device that displays the one-time password (e.g., Security
            token or card), hardware key using PKI (e.g., Yubikey) and
            biometrics using mobile devices. Additionally, the FPN may require
            an end user to activate multi-factor authentication as required by
            some business processes and security features (e.g., a business
            may require all managers to use multi-factor authentication to
            sign a payment order).

        <div class="faq-question">
          Who has the liability for funds held by consumers or businesses on
          the FPN?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The United States would have liability for Fed notes held by users
            of the FPN.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">
          How does the FPN incorporate a layered approach to fraud mitigation?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The FPN is designed with robust measures to prevent fraud. In
            addition to incorporating mechanisms to prevent fraud before it
            occurs, the FPN includes backend, real-time monitoring to spot
            exceptions that may indicate fraudulent transactions. The GO and
            those responsible for managing the FPN’s operations will analyze
            the exceptions data, then determine, develop and implement the
            correct response for handling exceptions that have been
            identified. For example, the fraud detection group may discover a
            common pattern of individuals transferring small amounts among
            many payment addresses to hide the possession history, then
            aggregating the value into a single payment address to be spent or
            deposited into an account at a depository institution. In response
            to detecting this sort of pattern, the fraud detection group could
            write and implement processes and procedures to suspend payment
            addresses that are participating in the detected pattern.
            Suspended payment addresses could then be evaluated and
            investigated.

        <h4>Disputed Payments</h4>

        <div class="faq-question">
          Who is liable for erroneous payments?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            As with physical cash payments, payers who use the FPN are liable
            for erroneous payments. The proposer believes that, while there is
            some risk to consumers within such a system, the benefits of the
            FPN (speed and reduced transaction costs) outweigh those risks. A
            payer must authorize a payment order before Fed notes are
            transferred to the payee. The FPN requires the payer to present
            credentials on the system before submitting payment orders, and it
            clearly communicates that the payment will be immediate and
            irreversible. A payer is responsible to protect his credentials as
            carefully as he would protect his wallet if he were using physical
            cash.
          </p>
          <p>
            The FPN should be seen as an option for payers to supplement the
            payment options currently available. The FPN is an appealing
            alternative for transactions, such as purchasing fuel at a pump,
            where the payer has no need of additional consumer protections,
            has no misgivings about making an irreversible payment, and may
            reap benefits of reduced costs. A payer who has misgivings about
            irreversible payments may choose other, existing payment systems
            that have costs associated with these protections built in.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">
          What is the recourse for a payer if goods or services provided are not satisfactory?
        </div>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Payers who use the FPN have the same modes of recourse as payers
            who use physical cash payments. They can work with the payee to
            arrange a refund. Payees are motivated to maintain their
            customers’ good will, so it is reasonable to assume that this
            mechanism for resolving disputes will be satisfactory most of
            time. Then if the payee is fraudulent or not cooperative, the
            payer can work through existing systems, such as the court system,
            to recover losses. While these mechanisms are more onerous than
            calling a financial institution and demanding a refund of disputed
            payments, the payer who uses the FPN does not bear the burden of
            the hidden costs associated with existing systems that shift
            financial liability for such transactions to financial
            institutions, which must then recover their costs by charging
            higher fees to customers.
