        <h2 class="section-title">THE PROPOSAL</h2>
        <p>
          The WingCash solution proposal, known as the Faster Payments Network (FPN), is a software platform that, as proposed, would be owned and operated by the Federal Reserve Bank and the "Governing Organization" (GO).
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="image/cash-to-digital.png" width="60%"
            class="diagram"  />
        </p>
        <p>
          The FPN uses a digital currency for payment. This currency, called "digital Fed notes," would be issued by the Federal Reserve and would be published at a domain under the control of the Federal Reserve (i.e., fednotes.com). The Federal Reserve would control the digital fed notes, but authenticated individuals and businesses would be able to hold, transfer possession of, and deposit these notes.

        <h2 class="section-title">HOW IT WORKS</h2>
        <p>
          The solution's end-to-end payment process begins with a person or business enrolling in the FPN, then continues through the iterative steps of authentication, payment order, receipt, and optional reconciliation upon conversion or redemption of Fed notes in US dollars or other currency.
        </p>

            class="diagram"  />
        </p>
        <p>
          The FPN uses a digital currency (digital fiat currency) for payment. This currency, called "digital fed notes," would be issued by the Federal Reserve and is tied to the Federal Reserve Bank's internet domain (fednotes.com). The Federal Reserve would control the digital fed notes, but authenticated individuals and businesses would be able to hold, transfer possession of, and deposit these notes.
