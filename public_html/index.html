            The national digital currency platform proposed by WingCash in 2016
            is now operating for financial institutions as an instant payment
            network called the Open Payment Network (OPN&reg;). This website has
            been updated to reflect the current name; however, the original
            solution proposal remains unchanged. The original proposal, which
            is available in PDF form includes an executive summary, a detailed
            description of the solution, and the independent assessment by
            subject matter experts from McKinsey and Company.

        <h2 class="section-title">INSTANT PAYMENTS</h2>
        <p>
          Open Payment Network&trade; (OPN) helps financial institutions
          attract and retain more customers and stay ahead of the competition
          by enabling them to deliver instant payment services anytime,
          anywhere. Using OPN’s secure technology platform, financial
          institutions can deliver cutting-edge services, such as instant
          mortgage payments, instant payroll processing, instant peer-to-peer
          payments, multi-currency payments, and more. The OPN platform
          connects with existing core systems, moving payment value and
          associated data in real time for safe, secure and immediate
          settlement. At the application level, the OPN API enables a financial
          institution to meet or exceed its customer expectations by enabling
          OPN customers and developers to enhance existing applications with
          instant payments or to create innovative apps that facilitate instant
          payments.

        <h2 class="section-title">INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT</h2>
        <p>
          The Federal Reserve created a team called the Faster Payments Task
          Force (FPTF) to evaluate proposed payment systems that would use new
          technology to enable faster payments without sacrificing features,
          such as security and scalability, that protect the financial networks
          and are expected by consumers. The FPTF hired experts from McKinsey
          and Company to perform the assessments. These experts were also
          called the Qualified Independent Assessment Team (QIAT).
        <p>
        </p>
          OPN received the highest quantitative score from among the 16 solution
          proposals assessed by the QIAT as shown in the graphics below.

              Method of Calculation: The authors, Stephen G. Cecchetti and
              Kermit L. Schoenholtz, constructed the chart to summarize
              McKinsey’s assessment of the 16 available proposals. For each of
              the 36 subcategories, they numerically coded the evaluations as
              follows: Very Effective―4, Effective―3, Somewhat Effective―2,
              Not Effective―1. They then averaged the scores within each of
              the six major categories, which they weighted equally in
              constructing a summary score out of 100.
